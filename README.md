# Triage Agent Bob

Triage Agent Bob is a lightweight hackathon prototype for real-time on-call triage. It turns a raw production alert into a plain-English first-response brief, remembers investigation context across open incidents, and generates an end-of-shift handoff in one click.

## What It Shows

- Alert Translator: raw alert to severity, affected area, likely files, relevant commits, and first checks
- Shift Brain: open incident list, instant re-brief, and investigation notes per incident
- Handoff Generator: select incidents and export a structured Markdown handoff
- Bob action log: visible evidence of Bob translating, mapping repo context, and drafting next steps
- Regression Radar: paste a PR diff and compare it against active incident areas
- Local fallback: useful demo output even when model credentials are not configured

## Local Use

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

If that port is already busy, Vite will use the next available port and print the URL.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
node server.js
```

## IBM Bob Setup

This repo includes project-level IBM Bob configuration:

- `.bob/custom_modes.yaml` defines the `triage-partner` custom mode.
- `.bob/rules-triage-partner/` defines the JSON response contract Bob should return.
- `.bob/commands/triage-alert.md` adds a `/triage-alert` command for raw alert analysis.

When the project is opened in IBM Bob, Bob should detect the project mode from `.bob/custom_modes.yaml`. The app backend can also call an IBM Bob gateway endpoint when these environment variables are set:

```text
IBM_BOB_API_URL=https://your-bob-endpoint.example
IBM_BOB_API_KEY=your_bob_token
IBM_BOB_MODE=triage-partner
IBM_BOB_PROJECT_ID=optional_project_id
```

If those values are not configured, the app falls back to the optional model providers below, then to the local demo triage playbook.

## Optional Model Setup

The API can call Qwen through DashScope's OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```text
QWEN_API_KEY=your_qwen_or_dashscope_key
QWEN_MODEL=qwen-plus
QWEN_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
```

`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` also works in place of `QWEN_API_KEY`.

Optional OpenRouter fallback:

```text
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=qwen/qwen3.6-plus
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://your-site.example
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=Triage Agent Bob
```

## Optional Supabase Setup

Run the SQL in `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor. The app writes through the server API with a server-side key.

```text
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_server_side_key
```

## Demo Story

1. Start with the checkout latency alert.
2. Run Alert Translator and point to the plain-English summary, affected files, and first three checks.
3. Switch to Shift Brain, add a note, and show Bob re-briefing the incident.
4. Open Handoff Generator, select incidents, and copy or download the Markdown handoff.
5. Use Regression Radar to show Bob comparing a PR diff against active incident history.
